					<h2> About Me
					</h2>
					<p>I'm a problem solver with a passion for analysis, whether it's strategizing in Brazilian
						Jiu-Jitsu or navigating the world of finance. In 2020, I shifted from exercise science to
						cryptocurrency trading, seamlessly blending fundamental and technical analyses.</p>

					<p>This transition not only reshaped my career but also deepened my love for data-driven
						decision-making. The tangible results of my predictions solidified my commitment to strategic
						and analytical thinking. This change
						allowed me to make decisions based on both analysis and economic knowledge I've gathered over
						the years.</p>
